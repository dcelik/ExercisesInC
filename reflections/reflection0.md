The teaming exercise that we did on the first day was a good idea that I think was a bit too pressuring. While I liked that we had the chance to see which people had similar interests as us and also got to hear some of the project ideas people had, it felt that the idea of committing to a single team would constrain a student too much. While I think that it resulted in students merging into teams of like interest, I think that was more of people seeing which friends had the same interests and trying to create groups as such. I myself am guilty of thinking partially that way. 

In addition, I think that the teaming exercise could have been improved by gauging peoples skill level at C so that people with more experience could tailor the sprints to more favor deeper learning of their project area. While that worked out for me in the end, it definitely lead to extra time spent during the teaming phase that could have been avoided or clarified. Overall, I think the teaming exercise, while pressure filled did yield good results. 

As for our project, I am really enjoying the direction our group has taken and am looking forward to working hard to learn deeply about such C exploits. I also am really liking the fact that we can zoom through the more basic C stuff instead of having to go more slowly in a lecture based setting, definitely helps foster intrinsic motivation and passion for the class material!
